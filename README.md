#### This Classic SDK is not actively supported and will be deprecated in the future. For full support on new integrations, please use the [PayPal .NET SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-NET-SDK)

## TLSv1.2 Update
> **The [PCIv3.1 DSS (PDF)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-1.pdf) mandates (p.46) that TLSv1.0 be retired from service by June 30, 2016. All organizations that handle credit card information are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, PayPal is updating its services to require TLSv1.2 for all HTTPS connections. [Click here](https://github.com/paypal/tls-update) for more information.**

> A new `mode` has been created to test if your server/machine handles TLSv1.2 connections. Please use `security-test-sandbox` mode instead of `sandbox` to verify. You can return back to `sandbox` mode once you have verified.
